This collection provides a syntax for inductively defined predicates
(e.g., typing rules) and a tool for generating random objects that
satisfy those predicates (e.g., typing derivations).

The collection can be used by specifying its path, for example,

(require "predicates/main.rkt")

but building the documentation requires a couple steps.

1. Create a PLaneT hard link to this directory.

$ raco planet link $username predicates.plt 1 0 .

(This collection isn't actually distributed via PLaneT; we're just
piggybacking on the convenience of its development links.
Consequently, the particular username and version numbers aren't
important.)

2. Build the collection.

$ raco setup -P $username predicates.plt 1 0

After complete these steps, the collection can be used without
directly specifying its path.

(require (planet $username/predicates:1:0))
